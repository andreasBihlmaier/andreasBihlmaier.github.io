title: Foldable Coordinate System: Print, Cut, Fold, Glue and Profit
---

Sometimes it is much easier to augment reality with real items instead of virtual augmentation.
In this spirit, I tried to find a template for printable - _not_ 3D - coordinate systems, e.g. the classical 3D cartesian coordinate system with RGB axis, but failed to find one.

The result of creating my own can be downloaded as [PDF](https://github.com/andreasBihlmaier/andreasBihlmaier.github.io/blob/master/data/PDF/coordinate_system_paper_folding.pdf).
