title: Welcome post

On this blog, I intend to write about topics related to robotics research, with special regards to open-source solutions.
The goal is to share the solutions that are either already out there, are extensions to existing ones or had to be purpose-built.
For the foreseeable future most posts will be related to Linux, ROS, Gazebo, OpenCV, SciPy, FreeCAD and KiCad.
Furthermore, if I finally get around to actually add substantial content to [allmyalgorithms.org](http://allmyalgorithms.org), there will be posts about open-source algorithm libraries, too.

The first real post will be about \"Open-Source Workflow to Create Geometrically and Visually Accurate Gazebo Models\".
